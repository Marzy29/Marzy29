ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Marzy29
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about web and mobile app development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning dynamic web development using Node.js, Express, and CSS, while exploring AI integration and crypto-based applications.
ðŸ¤– Iâ€™ve been experimenting with ElizaOS and building AI-driven agents to enhance user interaction and automation.
âš¡ Iâ€™m always open to learning â€” if you have any tips or insights on software development, AI, or computer science, feel free to connect!
